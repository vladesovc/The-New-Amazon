## Description
   The motivation behind this product is to help establish an up to date e commerce database, that helps my company help compete with modern tech companies. I made it to help boot my companies, sales, and user axtivity by making it more user friendly with newer technology database use. It solves the problem of having an out of date database search system and now gives it a much needed update. I learned alot about path and routing, file and folder structure, and that punctuation REALLY matters!
